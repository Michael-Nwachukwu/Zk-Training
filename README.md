## Introduction

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) are a powerful cryptographic concept enabling one party to prove the validity of information without revealing the information itself. This repository serves as a training ground to understand, implement, and experiment with ZKP using the Rust programming language.

## Features

- Hands-on exercises for understanding ZKP concepts.
- Implementation of zero-knowledge proof protocols in Rust.
- Progress tracking and learning resources.
- Modular codebase for experimenting with cryptographic ideas.

## Technologies Used

- **Rust:** The primary programming language for implementations.
- **Makefile:** For build automation and task management.
- **LLVM:** Contributing to low-level optimizations.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the repository locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Michael-Nwachukwu/Zk-Training.git](https://github.com/Michael-Nwachukwu/Zk-Training.git)
    cd Zk-Training
    ```

2.  **Install Rust (if not already installed):**

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf [https://sh.rustup.rs](https://sh.rustup.rs) | sh
    ```

3.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

4.  **Run tests to verify setup:**

    ```bash
    make test
    ```

## Usage

The repository is structured to include various modules corresponding to different ZKP concepts. Each module comes with its own README or documentation.

1.  **Navigate to a specific module:**

    ```bash
    cd modules/<module_name>
    ```

2.  **Run examples or exercises:**

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

3.  Explore and modify the code to deepen understanding.
